**BASIC NEEDS SECURITY** 

Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact [Student Support Services](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/support-services). Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.

In short, if you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION**
 
My goal is to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Pierce records, please let me know! 

Creating this environment also includes my commitment to value the diversity of our language practices. School for many is often a place where judgements about language have been harnessed both intentially and unintentionally to marginalize people and set-up barriers to success. The composition classroom is a place where we can come to more critically understand how language plays a role in issues of inclusion/exclusion in the world.

I (like all us) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, as a participant in course discussions and work, I expect you to also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.

**SUPPORT and RESOURCES**

From Access and Disability Services (ADS) to Multicultural Services to Tutoring,  a variety of support services exist at Pierce College.

Students in need of additional support for any reason should seek out the appropriate services so you can make necessary arrangements. If you are not sure where to go or who to seek out please speak with me so I can help you get where you want to go. If I do not know the answer to a question I will always be more than happy to help you find out who does have an answer.

A good starting point is the [Support Services page](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/support-services) on the Pierce College website.

Again, do not hesitate to have a conversation with me about support and services. Your success is important to me and I’m willing to help you find what you need.


**NON-DISCRIMINATION**

Pierce College is committed to creating quality educational opportunities for a diverse community of learners. Pierce does not discriminate against its students or employees based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation In this class we will strive to maintain an open atmosphere with shared respect for all differences.


**CONTACT ME**

Email (jloan@pierce.ctc.edu) is the best way to contact me. Typically, you can expect a reply to an email within 24 hours; however, response times for emails received over the weekend will vary and may not receive a reply until Monday.

I do have an office phone. The # is 253-964-6312. I recommend emailing me first. I will not check my voice mail as often as my email, so the reply time will be faster.

Stopping in to see me during my office hours or making an appointment to meet with me are both an expectation and a great way to have questions answered, receive feedback and to talk about the work of our course. I will do my best through out the semester to work with you so, again, don’t hesitate to initiate a conversation.
