## Ongoing, quarter long assignments:

* Research Log

* Sketch Book

### Research Logs

Each week you will document what you are learning in English 107 via a Research Log Entry. The goal of these entries is for you to capture the in-process moments of insight and learning, including the posing of questions. For each entry, I will offer some brief instructions via the course site as a starting point, and you are encouraged to extend your entries beyond these instructions as unanticipated things emerge in your work. These log entries wil also serve as a resource for the self-evaluations that will be central to our assessment of your work in the course. Research Logs should be composed in a Google Doc shared with me and other members of the class.
