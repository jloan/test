This week, use your research log space to do some writing in relation to your [Interpretive Prototype #2](https://jloan.github.io/e107v2/prototypes/2019/05/06/one-page-sabrina/). Here is a starting point question, but there certianly are others.

* What is your prototype one-page comic attempting to respond to? What do you find most intriguing or interesting about *Sabrina* and how is your prototype potentailly responding to that? It might also be that you are working from a place of disappointment in the text. You might find you are resistant to *Sabrina*'s take on something or to some key idea in the book. Remember -- something can be interesting or intriguing and not necessarily something we "like" or somethihg that comforms to our taste. You don't have to pretend or demonstarte to me that you like the book. What we do want to do is attempt to make some sense of the possible meanings of *Sabrina*.

For example, my own prototype is rooted in a couple of images that I've found to be the most intriguing from the book. This is one of those images:

I've found myself intrigued by the use of empty spaces and rooms in the story. And by empty, I mean empty of people.

So, I want to make a prototype that maybe amplifies this emptiness or sense of absence in someway. 

Interestingly, I've also found that even when sequences/scenes have people in them, these also for me have a feeling of a certain sort "emptiness" or "abscence." Not sure yet how to explain this but I am hoping that in the process of making my prototype some new ideas and questions will emerge.

One idea I have for my one-page comic is to reimagine a few scenes in the book that contain characters and conversations as actually being void of people. 

Not sure what it will amount to yet, but that's what I'm working with.
