* Introduce yourself. 
* Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions surrounding "writing about literature" as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the readings we have done this week?
* Describe and reflect on your work in building a prototype in response to Yancey. What questions or ideas emerge for you anout "writing in the 21st Century" or "writing about literature" in relation to your prototype and even the prototypes built by your peers? (Be sure to include images and other documentation for your prototype in your log.)
* Finally, as best you can, try to identify and describe what you think you learned this week.
