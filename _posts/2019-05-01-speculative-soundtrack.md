## Writing About *Sabrina* (an Experiment)

One of the developing ideas in this class has been to consider how creative practices -- like cartooning -- might be used in the service of writing about literature. To begin the quarter, we read Mark Sample's ["What's Wrong With Writing Essays."](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/42) In this short piece sample describes an assignment that he used in lieu of an essay to encourage what he called "difficult thinking":

>In my video game studies class, I asked students to design an abstract visualization of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game, a kind of model that would capture some of the gameâ€™s complexity and reveal underlying patterns to the way actions, space, and time unfold in the game.

As we finish reading Nick Drnaso's *Sabrina* I am going to ask you to engage in a short, experipental project that is meant to encourage *difficult thinking* as well as foster what might be called *creative analysis*.

## Here's Your Challenge

#### Make a Speculative Soundtrack in Response to *Sabrina*

Create an annotated list of six or more sounds that attempts to capture some of the books complexity and explore a main idea or central theme of Drnaso's book.

To compose your *speculative soundtrack* you will collect sound items from the Internet, embed them in an digital file, and then write around them with explanations and/or reflections. You should also include visuals and design elements into the soundtrack (i.e. details from *Sabrina* or perhaps even your own cartooning).

For this experiment, you should use a mix of audio materials. You can use musical selections, natural or human sounds, interviews, sounds from popular culture, or any other sonic sample that can be embedded into a digital file. Be sure to use a variety of kinds of sounds.

To collect items from the Net and then add your explanations and text, you will need to know a few things:

* Finding materials on YouTube or other sharing sites is a great place to start for your samples. You can also use other Web sites like Vimeo, the BBC, etc. Just make sure the samples can be embedded. 

* You can also find songs and sounds samples on sites like Soundcloud. If a perfect sound is available but not for embedding, you can create a link to the sound and add a tag so that it opens in a new window or tab.

* Since we are already using Google Docs for our class logs, I recommend that you try using [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/) to compose the prototype for your soundtrack. Here's [a model](https://sites.google.com/view/sabrina-speculative-soundrack/home) a put together using this service. I've Google Sites relatibvely easy for creating prototypes of media-rich documents. You may have another resource you feel comforatble using to share your sountrack and that's fine. Give it a shot.

Once you have gathered sound materials, create sections for the various items, and then compose your explanations/reflectuions in order to weave your speculative soundtrack to together into a unified text. 

In your writing aim to bring out the sonic dimensions of the elements you've selected. Describe elements of music and sound samples. Synthesize these details with aspects of the big idea you are attempting to articulate about *Sabrina*.

Successful soundtracks will include discussion of the sonic elements of the selections, avoid plot summary in favor of thematic exploration, and be delivered through compelling and polished language and visual presentation.
