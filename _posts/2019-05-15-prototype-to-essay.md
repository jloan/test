To date we've worked with cartooning and prototyping to attempt to get at some ideas about Nick Drnaso's graphic novel *Sabrina*.

The next phase in this process is to draft an essay rooted in the work of your prototyping/cartooning.

### Some Things to Work Toward

Our course objectives offer some guidedance to how we should approach this phase of our work.

* Your essay should offer a claim (or thesis) in response to *Sabrina*. This claim could explore the meaning and value of the work, or help us recognize the historical, social, philosophical, psychological, and/or cultural contexts that infrom *Sabrina*. (See Outcomes 1, 2 and 7)

* Your essay should be rooted in our processes of  prototyping. This includes your prtotyping work -- your cartooning experiments, interpretive/speculative prototypes 1 and 2. *Please note:* this *does not* mean that you have to arbitraily reference everything you've done (all the excercises, etc.). It does mean, however, that your claim and some of the support and development of it should be rooted in our prototyping work which is both a theoretical approach to literary study and a writing process. (See Outcomes 3 and 6)

* Your essay should attempt to utilize some of the ideas, concepts, and elements of the texts we read (Brunetti and McCloud) in developing your claim. (See Outcome 4)

* I do not expect that you will conduct any additional research for this essay, you may decide you want to integrate some additional reading into your work -- great. Make sure you cite any additional source material using a method you're comfortable with (e.g. MLA, APA, etc.). (See Outcome 5)

### But how long does it need to be?

Our course outcomes offer us no firm guidelines for a word count on our essay writing. And, admittedly, this is sort of a relief. That said, however, word counts and page lengths offer us some perameters and targets to aim for.

My sense of a reasonable length for the essay component of this assignment is that it could be successful and rich and well-developed in the range 0f 1000 - 1500 words. This is roughly 4 - 6 pages of double-spaced prose (not including the use of images or other grapics).
