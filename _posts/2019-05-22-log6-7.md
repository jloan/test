This week, use your research log space to: 

1. do some writing that considers the idea of *deformance* or the *deformed humanities* by both looking back and looking ahead.
2. Capture some things you learn about Butler and her work.

Consider:

* Based on Mark Sample's articulation of a [*deformed humanities*](http://www.samplereality.com/2012/05/02/notes-towards-a-deformed-humanities/), do you think the work we did in response to Sabrina -- the Brunetti crash course, Interpretive Prototypes #1 and #2, moving from prototype to essay -- fits into his vision of the *deformative* work? Why, or why not?

* Do some general research into Octavia Butler and her work. Give your reading of her work a little context. At this point, just do some general web searching. Capture here some of what you find. What jumps out at you? What do you notice? For example, I found out that *Parable* is being adapted into a graphic novel! I'm not sure if this counts as a trend, but I am intrigued by the growing number of novels getting graphic adaptations.

* Capture your initial reactions to Butler's text. Again, what's intriguing? What do you notice? Knowing where our work is headed, have any ideas begun to percolate?
