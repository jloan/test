# Some Context

*You might find this background interesting, and even necessarily, but you might also not and I'm cool with that. This is sort of thinking/making notes out loud. FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO THE OTHER STUFF* 

At the heart of my approach to teaching 107 is the tension between these two course outcomes:

* Write unified, coherent analytical essays that develop and support a thesis statement.
* Critically analyze literary works through the application of theoretical approaches.

So a big question guiding the course -- a question emerging I think from this tension -- goes something like this:

*What might it look like to write about literature in the 21st Century?*

Taking an even bigger step back, this question/tension for me has roots in Rhetoric and Composition scholarship that attempt to understasnd and articulate "new models" for composing (i.e. [Yancey](https://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/2852)) and the development of Digital Humanities which is also a space through which "new models" of scholarly communication and inquiry in the humanities are being experimented with (i.e. [Sayers](http://maker.uvic.ca/creative/)).

So...

*Write unified, coherent analytical essays that develop and support a thesis statement.* 

I am not opposed to essay writing...

I just think we could be more ambitious and playful in the ways we might get to the space of essay writing. Hence my plan in the first part of 107 being rooted in the making of comics as a means of inquiry -- through the prototyping/fabricating of comics we might develop some interesting questions that we could then explore in an essay.

*Critically analyze literary works through the application of theoretical approaches.*

I believe *making as critical method* is actually resonant with the "application of a theoretical approach" to writing about literature called ["deformance"](http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/old/deform.html) that was initially articulated by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels (and further by [Mark Sample](https://www.samplereality.com/2012/05/02/notes-towards-a-deformed-humanities/)).

I see then the first half of the class introducing this making as critical method approach...

The second half of the course will then dive a little deeper and extend this making as critical method approach via something that might be more appropriately labeled deformance. I don't know if I would actually have students read about "deformance" or if I'd even officially use the term...its after all a 100 level class...but the long and the short of it comes from this notion of deformance:

> [T]he critical and interpretive question is not 'what does the [work of literature] mean?' but 'how do we release or expose the [work of literature's] possibilities of meaning?' -- McGann and Samuels

We release it by BREAKING it. Breaking the object of interpratation itself and/or breaking the artifact used to communicate the critical/interpretive insights.

So mayve the course is better called somethig like:

Making Things, Writing Things, Breaking Things
