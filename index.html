      <h2>Welcome to English 107</h2>

<p>English 107 is a course designed to explore writing about literature. This iteration of the course will  experiment with the possibilities of comics both as works of literature and as a medium capable of being put to use in the practice of <em>writing about literature</em>. A key question guiding our work this quarter will be: How flexible are genres (like the essay) and mediums (like comics) in performances of knowledge-making and academic work? </p>

<p>To expore this question we will engage in what I hope is a novel research/writing process -- <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/prototype/">prototyping</a>. </p>

<p>Together we will explore the possibilities of writing about literature using prototyping as our method of inquiry. To put this another way -- we&#39;ll be making comics as a way into writing about this genre of literature and we will also experiment with prototyping comics as a potentially essayist medium in its own right.</p>

<h2>How will we do this?</h2>

<p>In the first half of the course, we will use Ivan Brunetti's <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300170993/cartooning"><em>Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice</em></a> and Scott McCloud's <a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/"><em>Understanding Comics</em></a> as guides to prototyping our own graphic work. Simultaneously, we will read Nick Drnaso's <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/sabrina"><em>Sabrina</em></a>. We will use our own comics making to generate questions we might explore in the process of writing about Drnaso's novel.</p>

<p>In the second half of the course, we&#39;ll turn from our own experiments with comics and writing about them to reading a more &quot;traditional&quot; novel -- Octavia Butler's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_(novel)"><em>Parable of the Sower</em></a>. We will take a big swing here, again using comics as prototypes for generating ideas and questions to explore in response to Buller's work. Finally, we will attempt to prototype the possibility of a <em>comic (or graphic) essay</em>. </p>
