## Deforming a novel into a score and recording.

Brendan's desire to convert/deform Parable into a score got me jazzed (pardon the pun). So I did some digging and it turns out there's "app" for that so to speak.

The P22 project developed this thing called the ["Music Text Composition Generator"](https://p22.com/musicfont/) and it put into action just this sort of novel -->score-->recording sort of deformance.

Check it out...

I used it to convert this bit of EARTHSEED:

"Prodigy is, at its essence, adaptability and persistent, positive obsession. Without persistence, what remains is an enthusiasm of the moment. Without adaptability, what remains may be channeled into destructive fanaticism. Without positive obsession, there is nothing at all. EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING"

INTO THIS PIECE OF [MUSIC](https://soundcloud.com/jasonloan/earthseed-music-1). Note: the "Music Text Composition Generator" creates a .mid file. I opened that file in GarageBand and exported is as an MP3, which is what I uploaded to SoundCloud.

You can see the score [here](deformance-excercises/Earthseed_music_1.pdf).

Long story short...this sort of deformance is a real possibility! Again, super jazzed and this sort of has my head spinning. Just a thought -- but how awesome would it be to use this tool to create a text-based score for the novel and have the Pierce College Orchestra perform it? Pretty awesome...
